# I2C-Virtual-Sensor-Communication
Simulates I2C communication between a virtual microcontroller and mock temperature sensor in Wokwi. Demonstrates address-based data transmission, sensor interfacing, and protocol understanding essential for embedded hardware integration.
This simulation showcases the use of the Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) protocol for master–slave communication between an MCU and a virtual sensor. Using Arduino’s Wire library, the controller periodically transmits a command to a mock temperature sensor with address 0x48, then reads one byte of returned data. The result is printed on the serial monitor, allowing observation of timing, addressing, and acknowledgment behavior without external components. The project emphasizes the structured two-wire nature of I2C (SDA + SCL) and demonstrates start/stop conditions, register addressing, and data retrieval sequences. Students can modify the code to simulate multiple sensors or extend the response size to emulate real-world devices such as accelerometers or EEPROMs. Because Wokwi includes virtual I2C peripherals, the project can be executed entirely online. This exercise builds confidence in sensor interfacing and helps visualize how microcontrollers manage synchronous communication at the firmware level. It also encourages the practice of writing scalable, interrupt-safe I2C routines suitable for multitasking environments, making it a strong foundation for any embedded engineer focusing on sensor networks or IoT hardware abstraction layers.
